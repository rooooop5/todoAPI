## 🚀 Current Improvements 🚀

This project is actively being improved as part of learning backend API design
and REST best practices.

## Planned Improvements

- [x] Separate request/response schemas from database models
- [ ] Refine filtering logic using dynamic query building
- [ ] Add pagination and sorting
- [x] Improve HTTP status code usage
- [x] Add centralized error handling
- [ ] Add unit tests for routes
- [ ] Improve database-level constraints

## Design Considerations

Some current design decisions are intentional tradeoffs to keep the code readable
while learning:
- DB models are temporarily reused as input schemas
- Certain endpoints prioritize clarity over pure REST style

These will be refactored incrementally.
